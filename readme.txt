Obtain buddypress components stats (Forums, Groups, Blogs, Comments, Activity, Friends) about the most active users in each of these components.


== Description ==

This plugin was originally created by Manichoo, however the current version of it does not work. This is my ongoing effort to get it working. So far I've got the basic reports for Activity, Groups, Forums, Comments (single site), Blogs (single site) and Friends working, The detail reports for Activity, Forums and Groups also work. I've tested the pdf export for Activity and that works however excel export does not work. I'm also refactoring it to get it in shape to be re-listed in wp.org.

This plugin allows you to run Database reports covering the various BuddyPress components ( Activity, Friends, Groups, Forums plus WordPress Blogs and Comments). It basically maps which users have been interacting with your site over your selected time periods.
