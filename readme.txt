Obtain buddypress components stats (Forums, Groups, Blogs, Comments, Activity, Friends) about the most active users in each of these components.


== Description ==

This plugin was originally created by Manichoo, however the current version of it does not work. This is my ongoing effort to get it working. I think I've been able to bring it back to it's original functionality plus I've added extra reports for single site owners. With this plugin you can generate and export to PDF and XLS Formats reports covering the following components: Activity, Groups, Forums, Comments (single site), Blogs/Posts (single site) and Friends. However there are still a few bugs in the exports that I'd like to see fixed. I'm also refactoring it to get it in shape to be re-listed in wp.org.

This plugin allows you to run Database reports covering the various BuddyPress components ( Activity, Friends, Groups, Forums plus WordPress Blogs and Comments). It basically maps which users have been interacting with your site over your selected time periods.
